# Project-0
First project for SEI = Tamagotchi Virtual Pet
Game Logic:

- create 3 ages for pet = Baby, Adult, Elder
- prompt: What is your name? Welcome player to game
- Input box for pet's name. Update the page with pet's name once button is clicked. 
- Buttons for feed, sleep, play - connect these to hunger, sleepiness, boredom levels
- Connect feed, sleep, play buttons to hunger Level, Tiredness Level and Boredom Level.
- Update age as the game progresses and pet evolves
- game over if hunger, boredom, sleepiness hit 0

Timer:
Start at 3000 seconds. When it hits 2000, evolve. When it hits 1000, evolve
- Game also over when timer reaches zero

Wellness Meters:
All start at 0.
Increase by 1 every 100s

Sleep button: 
Changes background to dark background when clicked.
Decreases 'sleep meter' by 1 when clicked
